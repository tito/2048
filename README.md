This game has been created from the game 2048 by [Gabriele
Cirulli](http://gabrielecirulli.com/), itself based on [1024 by Veewo
Studio](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/1024!/id823499224) conceptually similar
to [Threes by Asher Vollmer.](http://asherv.com/threes/).

This implementation uses only Kivy framework, and can be played on mobile with
swipes or desktop with keyboard.
